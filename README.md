[![PyPI Version](http://img.shields.io/pypi/v/Flask-OPA.svg)](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/Flask-OPA)

Simple to use [Flask](http://flask.pocoo.org/>) extension that lets you use
[Open Policy Agent](https://www.openpolicyagent.org) in your project.


## How to run the application

If you want to try a demo check the code in `examples`, but for development:

1. Run OPA in server mode

    * Check the [latest OPA release](https://github.com/open-policy-agent/opa/releases) and download it.
    * Put the binary file in the path of your system
    * Allow its execution with something like
    * Run opa in server mode with the sample policies
    
    ```bash
    cd examples
    opa run -s -w data.json app.rego
    ```
    
      - `-s` is to run it in server mode instead of opening the REPL
      - `-w` is for watching the changes of the data/policy files

1. Specify configuration variables

    * `OPA_URL` url string that specifies the OPA url to evaluate your input. It includes the path of the policy. E.g
    `http://localhost:8181/v1/data/examples/allow`.
    
    * `OPA_SECURED` boolean to specify if OPA will be enabled to your application.
    
    See more at the [rest api reference](https://www.openpolicyagent.org/docs/rest-api.html)

1. Bind the OPA class to your Flask application

    Its easy to bind the Flask-OPA library to your application. Just follow the following steps:

1. Create the OPA instance

    ```python
    app = Flask(__name__)
    app.config.from_pyfile('app.cfg')
    opa = OPA(app, parse_input)
    ```

    Lets see the parameters that we passed to the OPA class:
    
    - `parse_input` (Required) contains a method that returns the input data json to be evaluated by the policy, e.g.:

    ```json
    {
        "input": {
          "method": "GET",
          "path": ["data", "jon"],
          "user": "paul"
        }
    }
    ```
    
    - `url` (Optional) to use an specific url instead of the `OPA_URL` optionally specified in the app configuration.
    - `allow_function` (Optional) predicate that determinate if the response from OPA allows (True) or denies (False) the request
    
    If you want enforce the OPA security in your application you can create the OPA instance like this:
    
    ```python
    opa = OPA.secure(app, parse_input, url="http://localhost:8181/v1/data/package_name/allow")
    ```
    
    or
    
    ```python
    opa = OPA(app, parse_input, url="http://localhost:8181/v1/data/package_name/allow").secured()
    ```
    
    otherwise OPA will enforce your security only if ``OPA_SECURED`` is `True`.
    
    Specify the logging level to `DEBUG` if you want to get access to Flask-OPA logs of its operations using
    
    ```python
    app.logger.setLevel(logging.DEBUG)
    ```

1. Run your Flask application.
    
## Policy Enforcement point

For practical purposes, lets imagine a [sample](/examples) function that is in charge of logging content related to actions done by users. In
this case we must create a different input functions that provide useful information for certain policies that will decide
if a log should be sent or not to a remote server. Lets suppose that the logging function is something like:

```python
def log_remotely(content):
    # Imagine a code to log this remotely
    app.logger.info("Logged remotely: %s", content)
```

to decorate it we must implement a [PEP][PEP] using our `OPA` instance as a 
function (callable mode). The parameters are pretty much the same as those used to secure the application. 
The resulting instance will serve as decorator of our function of interest:

```python
def validate_logging_input_function(*arg, **kwargs):
   return {
        "input": {
            "user": request.headers.get("Authorization", ""),
            "content": arg[0]
        }
    }

secure_logging = app.opa("Logging PEP", app.config["OPA_URL_LOGGING"], validate_logging_input_function)

@secure_logging
def log_remotely(content):
    # Imagine a code to log content remotely
    app.logger.info("Logged remotely: %s", content)
```

As you might have noticed, the only thing we truly require for adding the [PEP][PEP] is a new input function. This function
can provide a more versatile input than the one used by the `OPA` instance created for the whole app: in our example it 
provides info related to the user request and info provided by the parameters of the decorated function as well.

Read the [examples README](examples/README.md) for more detailed information about how to run a demo.
