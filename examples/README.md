How to demo
============

## Run OPA in server mode

1. Check the [latest OPA release](https://github.com/open-policy-agent/opa/releases) and download it.
2. Put the binary file in the `PATH` of your system
3. Allow its execution with something like
    ```bash
    chmod 755 ~/opa
    ```
3. Run opa in server mode with the sample policies:

    ```bash
    cd examples
    opa run -s data.json app.rego
    ```
    
In this folder (examples) you will find a simple ``app.py`` file that contains endpoints to test how you can see some
data using OPA. For commodity purposes the user id will be passed in the request using the header *Authorization*.

> Run the app.py file with your IDE. It will run in http://localhost:5000
